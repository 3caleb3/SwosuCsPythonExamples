Getting ready to try tensorflow.

Started a new environment in anaconda called tensorflow.

I also started a new jupyter notebook.

https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/segmentation

Going to try to work through this process.

Going to notes called tensorflow_segmentation.md

now we are going to install the tenserflow package in anaconda.

I am up to Anaconda 2.1.4 now.
