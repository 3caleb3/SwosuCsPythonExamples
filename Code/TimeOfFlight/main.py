This is code to examine time of flight.
We are going to used closed form equations to solve for
the range an object flies.
We are then going to try to make an optimization that
finds the best possible angle for launch to get the gratest distance.
We know the answer should be 45 degrees.
We want to see if we can make an optimization tool that finds that for us.
