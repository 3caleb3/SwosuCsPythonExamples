# Building a Choose Your Own Adventure Guide
Welcome to a set of notes on how to make a choose your own adventure game. The goal is to have some fun with Python programming. The idea behind this is that you have several fun tools from working in programming classes, and now you can taste the fruits of your labor. Making your own story allows you to put your own stamp on an idea. Hopefully you enjoy your idea enough that you keep working on it. As you keep working on it, you will also keep making the game better. Improvements in the game will likely call on your programming and problem solving skills. Thank you for continuing to invest in your own personal development.

# Notes
Every level of learning can accommodate a different level of production. Even the humble print statement can be used to tell a joke.
>```python
print('I am not superstitious, but I am a little stitious.')
print('Michael Scott (Steve Carrell), The Office')
>```

The general idea is that stories are going to be able to grow to different sizes given your skill set. The goal is to provide some fun examples to get you started based on what is commonly covered in Chapters of common books.

## Chapter 1 list of tools

In chapter 1, there are some fun things to do. Here are a list of skills you can consider:
* Print statements where you keep things on the same line
```Python
# Including end=' ' keeps output on same line
print('Hello there.', end=' ')
```
* Printing a variable

```python
wage = 20

print('Wage is', end=' ')
print(wage)  # print variable's value
```
* printing things over multiple lines:
```python
print('1\n2\n3')
```

* Getting input from the users:
```python
print('Enter name of best friend:', end=' ')
best_friend = input()
print('My best friend is', best_friend)
```
## Chapter 1 ideas for fun
One way to start to have fun here is with some simple MadLibs. In this game, you ask the user to give you some words. Then you use the words in a story. This can lead to some funny results.
